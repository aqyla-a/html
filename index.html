         life is a river,winding and free
         craving its path to the endless sea
         rushing throught rapids,gentle and deep
         it whispers secrets,awake and asleep. 
                 each behind the jorney,each wav a song,
                 we drif through the current,carried along 
                 moments like ripples,brief yre brigh,
                 lost in the flow, yt touched by light
